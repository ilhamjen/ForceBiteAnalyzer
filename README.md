To use the code and files in Visual Studio, the most practical approach if you have the complete folder as shown in the image is to select the "Open a project or solution" option and open the file with the .csproj extension (in this case, Bismillah_FINAL_ForceBite.csproj). This will automatically load the entire solution structure. However, if you are manually reconstructing the project using only the MainForm.cs code, you need to create a new Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) project, rename the default Form1.cs file to MainForm.cs, and paste the entire attached code into it. Don't forget to adjust the entry point in Program.cs to execute new MainForm() and add an image named SPS_2 to Project Properties > Resources to prevent the 3D visualization section from throwing an error message when the application runs. Once configuration is complete, simply press F5 (Start) to launch the interactive simulation of the five sensors.
